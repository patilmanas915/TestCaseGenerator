# Feature Name "Unknown" Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified âœ…
The issue was that `test_generator_no_pandas.py` was using the wrong field name to extract feature names during progress reporting.

## Root Cause
- **GeminiClient returns**: `feature_name` in the JSON response
- **test_generator_no_pandas.py was looking for**: `name` field 
- **Result**: Always showing "Unknown" in progress messages

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed test_generator.py (Original Working Version) âœ…
```python
# BEFORE (was getting None)
feature.get('feature_name')

# AFTER (proper fallback logic)
feature_name = feature.get('feature_name', feature.get('name', f'Feature_{idx}'))
```

### 2. Fixed test_generator_no_pandas.py âœ…
```python
# BEFORE
progress_callback(f"Generating test cases for feature {i+1}/{len(features)}: {feature.get('name', 'Unknown')}")

# AFTER  
feature_display_name = feature.get('feature_name', feature.get('name', f'Feature_{i+1}'))
progress_callback(f"Generating test cases for feature {i+1}/{len(features)}: {feature_display_name}")
```

### 3. Updated app.py Import Priority âœ…
Changed to prefer the working `test_generator.py` first:
```python
# BEFORE: pandas-free version first
# AFTER: standard version first (better feature handling)
```

### 4. Enhanced Feature Data Mapping âœ…
Added proper feature information to each test case:
```python
for test_case in test_cases_data['test_cases']:
    test_case['feature_name'] = feature_name
    test_case['feature_id'] = feature.get('feature_id', feature.get('id', f'F{idx:03d}'))
    test_case['module'] = feature.get('module', test_case.get('module', 'Unknown'))
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### âœ… Instead of:
```
Generating test cases for feature 1/5: Unknown
Generating test cases for feature 2/5: Unknown
```

### âœ… You should now see:
```
Generating test cases for feature 1/5: User Authentication System
Generating test cases for feature 2/5: Payment Processing Module
```

## Testing the Fix

To test the fix, try uploading an FRD document now. You should see:

1. **Proper feature names** in progress messages
2. **Correct feature_name** in generated test cases
3. **Better Excel/CSV** output with actual feature names
4. **No more "Unknown"** feature names (unless the FRD extraction fails)

## Files Modified
- âœ… `test_generator.py` - Enhanced feature name extraction  
- âœ… `test_generator_no_pandas.py` - Fixed progress callback
- âœ… `app.py` - Updated import priority to use working version

The feature name issue should now be **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**! ðŸŽ‰

Try uploading a document and you should see actual feature names instead of "Unknown".
