### **ðŸŽ¯ Example Advanced Test Cases Generated**

#### **Conflict Resolution Test**
```
Test Case ID: TC015
Test Type: Conflict
Gap Coverage: Conflict Solver Detailed Messaging (FRD Â§3.4.3.1)

"The following test scenario for the Rib feature is derived from the corresponding line in the FRD document:

1. Launch Cimatron
2. Create complex shell part with interference areas
3. Create rib centerline that causes creation conflicts
4. Invoke Rib feature and attempt Complete Result
5. Observe conflict solver messaging
6. Verify 3-line format: creation conflict, switch to partial, list options to remove

Exp: System displays exact 3-line conflict message format as specified in FRD Â§3.4.3.1"
```

#### **Error Recovery Test**
```
Test Case ID: TC022
Test Type: Integration
Gap Coverage: Editing after Conflict (FRD Â§3.4.4)

"The following test scenario for the Rib feature is derived from the corresponding line in the FRD document:

1. Launch Cimatron
2. Create rib that results in creation failure
3. Note the conflicting options listed
4. Edit the rib feature
5. Remove the conflicting options as suggested
6. Retry Complete Result option
7. Verify successful rib creation

Exp: User can successfully remove options and retry Complete Result after initial failure"
```

#### **Fallback Mechanism Test**
```
Test Case ID: TC030
Test Type: Fallback
Gap Coverage: Fallback Rule "To Closest â†’ By Delta" (FRD Â§3.4.5.2)

"The following test scenario for the Rib feature is derived from the corresponding line in the FRD document:

1. Launch Cimatron
2. Create scenario where "To Closest" option fails
3. Invoke Rib with "To Closest" extents
4. Force failure condition
5. Verify automatic fallback to "By Delta"
6. Check that fallback produces correct result

Exp: System automatically falls back from 'To Closest' to 'By Delta' when primary option fails"
```

#### **Multi-Object Creation Test**
```
Test Case ID: TC038
Test Type: Integration
Gap Coverage: Multi-curve Rib Creation (FRD Â§3.4.7)

"The following test scenario for the Rib feature is derived from the corresponding line in the FRD document:

1. Launch Cimatron
2. Create 4 separate curves on shell face
3. Select all 4 curves for rib creation
4. Create rib feature
5. Check feature tree for object count
6. Verify 4 separate rib objects are created
7. Repeat with single sketch containing 4 curves
8. Verify single rib object is created

Exp: 4 separate curves create 4 rib objects, 1 sketch with 4 curves creates 1 rib object"
```

#### **Backward Compatibility Test**
```
Test Case ID: TC045
Test Type: Compatibility
Gap Coverage: Backward Compatibility (FRD Â§3.4.8)

"The following test scenario for the Rib feature is derived from the corresponding line in the FRD document:

1. Open legacy file with existing rib features
2. Verify old rib features display correctly
3. Edit existing rib feature
4. Verify legacy parameters still function
5. Create new rib using old workflow
6. Ensure new features don't break old ones

Exp: All legacy rib features remain fully functional and unaffected by new enhancements"
```
